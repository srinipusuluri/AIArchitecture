                <h4>Q: How do you ensure model fairness and prevent bias in AI systems?</h4>
                <p><strong>Answer:</strong> Bias mitigation requires a comprehensive approach:</p>
                <ul>
                    <li><strong>Data Audit:</strong> Analyze training data for representation bias and historical discrimination</li>
                    <li><strong>Feature Engineering:</strong> Remove or transform sensitive attributes and proxy variables</li>
                    <li><strong>Algorithmic Fairness:</strong> Use fairness-aware algorithms and regularization techniques</li>
                    <li><strong>Metric Monitoring:</strong> Track disparate impact, equal opportunity, and demographic parity</li>
                    <li><strong>Human Oversight:</strong> Implement human-in-the-loop validation for high-stakes decisions</li>
                    <li><strong>Continuous Monitoring:</strong> Deploy bias detection in production with automated alerts</li>

                <h4>Q: Explain the trade-offs between model accuracy and interpretability.</h4>
                <p><strong>Answer:</strong> The accuracy-interpretability trade-off is context-dependent:</p>
                <ul>
                    <li><strong>High-Stakes Decisions:</strong> Healthcare, finance, and legal domains prioritize interpretability for compliance and trust</li>
                    <li><strong>Scale vs Explainability:</strong> Complex models (deep learning) offer higher accuracy but are harder to interpret</li>
                    <li><strong>Hybrid Approaches:</strong> Use interpretable models for critical paths and complex models for auxiliary tasks</li>
                    <li><strong>Post-hoc Methods:</strong> SHAP, LIME, and attention mechanisms can provide explanations for complex models</li>
                    <li><strong>Business Requirements:</strong> Balance regulatory needs, user trust, and performance requirements</li>

                <p><strong>Answer:</strong> A global recommendation system requires:</p>
                <ul>
                    <li><strong>Multi-Region Deployment:</strong> Edge locations for low-latency inference with regional model variants</li>
